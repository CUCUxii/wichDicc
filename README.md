# wichDicc
A "SecList" dictionary simple finder for Linux

Sometimes the SecList dictionary can be a bit confusing when looking for something in particular (like a dictionary for fuzzing subdomains)
So this code, returns the path of the dictionary needed for every matter. Copy it and dont waste more time.

In case of you dont have the SecLists installed, the program install it for you.
