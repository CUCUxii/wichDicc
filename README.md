# wichDicc
A "SecList" dictionary simple finder for Linux

Sometimes the SecList dictionary can be a bit confusing when looking for something in particular (like a dictionary for fuzzing subdomains)

So this code, returns the path of the dictionary needed for every matter. Copy it and dont waste more time.
